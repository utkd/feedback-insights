It feels slower and less responsive all the time. Opening the context menu for a song specifically is slow, almost always displaying a loading spinner for several seconds.
Update Nov 01, 2024 - The app has been SO SLOW lately. Where's the increased subscription money going if not for making your service work?
Update June 10, 2024: I'm really getting tired of the ever-present bugs. I went on a camping trip out where there is absolutely no cell service and had download a significant amount of music to listen offline. My phone was in airplane mode and Spotify in offline mode the entire time. I listened to albums the first two days, but on the third day, Spotify started giving me the error ""Spotify is offline. Go online to listen."" (Or something like that), every time I tried to listen to a downloaded album. I really, really don't care about all these new superficial features that keep getting added. If Spotify keeps raising the cost and doesn't keep the core stable, I'm leaving for Apple Music or Tidal. Update April 03, 2024: The latest issue with Spotify that's been going on for months now is really disruptive. Whatever they've done has introduced a chronic lag between when an action is taken (playback controls, selecting a song, etc) and when the action executes. It's 4-5 seconds. It's especially bad when the app transitions from background to foreground, but it is not confined to that scenario. This is the least consistent service I've ever paid for, and I've had internet service from both Comcast and CenturyLink. Original review: Spotify as a service is second to none. The music exploration and discovery that it enables is where it's always shined. The app is garbage. As long as I've been a subscriber- over 6 years- the app has been consistently broken in one or more ways. And there's no portal to customer service or feedback through the app. They just don't care. New features clearly take precedence over the stability of existing functionality.","Update Feb 03, 2025

Update: Spotify user since… 2015? STOP PUSHING PODCASTS, I DON’T CARE. Also leave the “recently played” bar on the home page, I want to remember if I’ve been listening to something I haven’t “saved” (because apparently we can’t “like” songs anymore which is also dumb, bring my heart button back). Spotify, I love you, but this is a 2-way relationship here. 
(Older review) I love Spotify and have used the app religiously for over 5 years. So, feedback time: the new update has two problems. First, the music keeps randomly stopping in the middle of songs. This happens exclusively on my phone, headphones or no headphones. The app and my phone are all up to date, yet every so often the song stops and the when I go back to hit play again it continues like nothing happened. Second, the new format for the way the now playing songs at the bottom of the app is terrible. It looks almost *exactly* the same as songs in a regular playlist/album in terms of background color (black), album image size, and font size. This is not a great feature for a normally abled sighted person, but I imagine there are some accessibility issues here. Another feature that is absolutely killing me recently is the “featured podcasts” that line the top of my recommended music section. Come on Spotify, how much are they paying you????? If I wanted to listen to podcasts, I *have* an app for that. The only nice feature you have that Apple doesn’t is the sleep timer. 
Finally, personal comment, but the reviews of people upset because there are ads in the “free” music streaming app are hilarious. Just pay for it and literally ALL of your problems will go away (unlimited skips, only songs you put in your playlist will play, also no ads……) Seriously if you think about it’s cheaper than the price of actually buying 1 new album per month and you get unlimited access to basically all the music you could possibly want. Just saying.","Update again: stop with the AI.

However, what annoys me (and that's why only three stars): Audiobooks are treated like a music playlist, which means that the playback position is not saved and you don't know where you were when the system crashes (which happens from time to time with a bad network) or if you want to listen to music in between.
Moreover, it sometimes happens that the audiobook starts completely from the beginning when I, for example, turn off the ignition in the car without ending the audiobook first. In all cases, I have to find the right spot again, which is very tedious and time-consuming when audiobooks often have hundreds of tracks!! With Apple Music, it's different; there you can continue listening after weeks where you left off. Unfortunately, the selection of audiobooks there is more than mediocre, which is why I still end up listening on Spotify... 
It would be nice if Spotify would also remember the playback position for audiobooks!!","Ich höre fast ausschließlich Hörbücher und die Auswahl ist wirklich phänomenal! Was mich aber ärgert (und deshalb auch nur drei Sterne): Hörbücher werden wie eine Musikplaylist behandelt, was heißt, dass die Wiedergabeposition nicht gespeichert wird und man nicht mehr weiß, wo man war, wenn das System mal abgestürzt ist (was bei schlechtem Netz immer mal wieder passiert) oder man zwischendrin doch mal Musik hören möchte.
Zudem passiert es immer mal wieder, dass das Hörbuch komplett von vorne anfängt, wenn ich z.B. beim Auto die Zündung ausschalte ohne vorher das Hörbuch zu beenden. In allen Fällen muss ich wieder die richtige Stelle finden, was bei Hörbüchern mit oft hunderten von Tracks sehr mühsam und zeitaufwändig ist!! Bei Apple Musik ist das anders, da kann man auch nach Wochen da weiterhören, wo man aufgehört hat. Leider ist dort die Hörbuchauswahl mehr als mäßig, weshalb ich dann halt doch über Spotify höre…

Previously, searching for an artist (like Bruno Mars) would display their profile at the top with their albums, songs, and related content in a clear, structured format.

☆ Offline playback is possible
You can set high quality and low quality
☆ Can be used for free
(Apple Music seems to charge a monthly fee after a free trial)
(Paid plan (Premium) is also available)
☆ Can register with an email address
(YouTube Music requires a Google account)
Bad points
☆ Even if I create a playlist by adding my favorite songs, Spotify adds songs to it (the same goes for favorite songs)
→ Only the songs added by Spotify play, and I can't listen to the songs I've added
☆ Cannot arrange the order of songs in the playlist to my liking
☆ When I search for a song I want to hear and press the play button for that song, a different song plays (Spotify recommended songs play)
I think that if you get Premium (paid plan), you can listen to your favorite songs comfortably
I recommend it for people who want to discover various songs, but I don’t think it’s suitable for those who just want to listen to their favorite songs…
I apologize for the long text m(_ _)m","良い点　
☆オフライン再生ができる
高音質、低音質が設定できる
☆無料で使える
(Apple Musicは、無料体験後、月額取られるっぽい)
(有料プラン(プレミアム)も有り)
☆メールアドレスで登録できる
(YouTube musicは、Googleアカウント持ってないとだめでした)
悪い点
☆好きな曲を追加してプレイリストを作っても、Spotifyがそこに曲を追加してしまう(お気に入りの曲でも同様)
→Spotifyが追加した曲ばかり流れて、自分が追加した曲が聞けない
☆プレイリストの曲順を、好きな順番に出来ない
☆聞きたい曲を検索して、その曲の再生ボタンを押しても、違う曲が流れる(Spotifyおすすめの曲が流れる)
たぶんですが、プレミアム(有料プラン)にすれば好きな曲を快適に聞けると思います

While it offers a vast music library, the overall experience is riddled with issues that make it frustrating to use.
1. Too Many Ads (Even for Free Users!)
If you’re using the free version, get ready to be bombarded with ads every few songs. And no, they’re not short ads—you’ll be forced to listen to long, repetitive ones that ruin the experience. Sometimes, the same ad plays multiple times in a row!
2. Poor Shuffle Algorithm
Spotify’s shuffle feature feels broken. It tends to play the same songs repeatedly, even in large playlists. This makes the “random” function feel useless, especially when you’re trying to discover new music.
3. Removing Features Users Love
Spotify has a habit of removing useful features without explanation. Lyrics disappeared for some users, the ability to listen to specific songs on mobile (without Premium) is gone, and the queue management is clunky. They seem more focused on pushing Premium subscriptions than actually improving the app.
4. Expensive Premium with Limited Benefits
Speaking of Premium, the subscription price keeps increasing, but the benefits remain the same. Even with Premium, you still can’t access lossless audio like other services offer at the same price. Why pay so much when alternatives like Apple Music or YouTube Music provide better quality?
5. Offline Downloads Are Unreliable
Even Premium users face issues when downloading songs. Songs randomly disappear, downloads fail, and the app sometimes forces you to reconnect to verify your subscription—defeating the purpose of offline listening!
6. Unfair Treatment of Artists
Spotify pays artists very little compared to other platforms. Musicians struggle to earn decent revenue, even if their songs get millions of streams. Meanwhile, Spotify spends billions on exclusive podcast deals instead of supporting the artists who keep the platform alive.
Final Verdict: Not Worth It
While Spotify has a massive music collection and an easy-to-use interface, its flaws outweigh the positives. The app feels like it’s designed to push users into a never-ending cycle of ads and Premium subscriptions while failing to deliver the best music experience. If you care about quality, fairness to artists, and a true shuffle experience, look elsewhere.
⭐ Rating: 2/5 – Overrated and frustrating!","Spotify might be one of the most popular music streaming apps, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best. While it offers a vast music library, the overall experience is riddled with issues that make it frustrating to use.

So, I can't remove songs that are coming, can't add them directly to the queue, or anything else. It really gets on my nerves so much that I would be happy if the app developers would provide the options to adjust things ourselves. Just give us the chance to decide how we want things.

I have to push it down to be sure I don't listen to it right away. 
It’s full of little details that waste time, are annoying, and make the experience worse... Yet I really liked Spotify and have been a user for a very long time.

De plus depuis cette même maj, quand on met par erreur le même son 2x en file d’attente on a plus la possibilité de le supprimer de la liste d’attente… je suis obligée de le descendre pour être sure de pas l’écouter tout de suite.

I would like to thank you immensely. It is a user-friendly app and very good suggestions are made for music that you might like. The only thing is that I can't listen without WiFi. Of course, I can upload my account, but I really don't want to, because then you not only hear music but also NO ads, and I actually enjoy hearing those ads (but okay, I am also the daughter of an ad maker 🙂).

I am told to wait until next month to have 10 more hours of listening. I don't find this logical since I PAY for a subscription that is already quite EXPENSIVE. 
Also, I would like to mention a few words regarding the ads. I plan to switch back to a free account, and after my several years of experience on a free account, I have noticed the increase in frequency of ads, which are longer than the others. There are way too many ads already, and we can hardly do anything on Spotify except listen to music while turning off our phones. We cannot choose the music we want without another random song playing, we cannot skip more than 6 times, there are tons of ads, we cannot listen to certain podcasts (which is a bit logical, but since we only get 10 hours of listening per month while being premium, I no longer find this logical at all), and many other things. So imposing so many ads while there are all these flaws on the side, I don't think that it's reasonable. Just reducing the flow of ads would be preferable not only to attract the audience but also money.","Bonjour, je paye un abonnement premium depuis quelques mois maintenant et déjà que le prix est assez élevé, je ne suis même pas libre d'écouter mes podcasts inclus avec premium le temps que je veux. On me demande d'attendre le mois prochain pour pouvoir avoir 10 heures d'écoutes de plus. Chose que je ne trouve pas logique puisque je PAYE un abonnement déjà assez CHER. 
Puis aussi, j'aimerais toucher deux mots par rapport aux pubs. Je compte re basculer sur un compte gratuit et après mon expérience de plusieurs années sur un compte gratuit, j'ai remarqué l'évolution de fréquences des pubs plus longues les unes que les autres. Il y a beaucoup trop de pubs déjà qu'on ne peut presque rien faire sur Spotify a pars écouter des musiques en éteignant son téléphone. On ne peut pas choisir la musique que l'on veut sans qu'il y en ait une autre aléatoire qui se lance, on ne peut pas passer plus de 6 fois, on a énormément de pubs, on ne peut pas écouter certains podcasts (chose un peu logique mais du moment ou on a que 10 heures d'écoute par mois en étant premium je ne trouve plus du tout cela logique), et encore beaucoup d'autres choses. Alors nous imposer autant de publicités alors qu'à côté il y a tous ces défauts, je ne pense pas que ce soit raisonnable. Juste baisser le flux de publicité serait préférable pour non seulement attirer du public mais aussi de l'argent.",9.0.14,,,,2,0,fr

Therefore, it is very difficult to go back and find the songs you have listened to. On the other hand, a huge effort is made to suggest you all sorts of things you are not interested in. For example, the list ""songs you like"" is filled with songs I hate and have never chosen. I feel trapped in a lot of algorithms that lead me to places that have nothing to do with me. I do not understand why there is not a proper option to customize these algorithms, and an opportunity to set up the functions that you really need. It is indeed a bit difficult to avoid Spotify, which is present in most music streaming players.","Jeg oplever Spotify som en meget uoverskuelig app. F.eks. er der ikke en liste med alle de numre du har trykket afspil på. Derved er det meget svært at søge tilbage i de numre du har hørt. Til gengæld bliver der gjort et kæmpe nummer ud af at foreslå dig alt mulig som du ikke er interesseret i. F.eks. er listen “sange du synes godt om”, fyldt med numre jeg hader, og som jeg aldrig har valgt. Jeg føler mig fanget i en masse algoritmer der fører mig steder hen som intet har med mig at gøre. Jeg forstår ikke hvorfor der ikke er ordentlig mulighed for at detailstyre disse algoritmer, og en mulighed for selv at opsætte de funktioner man virkelig har brug for.

(I apologize for the long text.)
It’s been a few years since I subscribed to the paid (premium) service, and there hasn't been anything better than this yet.
If it’s fine to use for free, you should try switching to the paid service.
Even if the sound quality is good, it’s more suited for those who have really good equipment, so I keep coming back.
The recommendations are wonderful, and that’s why I’m using the paid version.
I often hear songs that are not to my taste, but I can simply evaluate and let it know what I don’t like.
I recommend it for those who want to discover new music and genres.","使い勝手わかったので改めて。

Also, now you can only skip a maximum of 6 times, you can't see the lyrics more than twice a month, and there are a lot of ads. I understand that they want people to pay for the premium plan, but they can't reach the point where a person can't choose the song they want to listen to. So what’s the point of an app to listen to music if you can't listen to the song you want to listen to? As the word suggests, LISTEN, not an app deciding what song to play for you. A total mess.","Me parece horrible de que ahora tengan un máximo para elegir las canciones que quieras poner, y cuando se acabe el maximo Spotify te elige la canción aleatoriamente, también ahora para pasar la canción es un máximo de 6 veces, no puedes ver la letra más de dos veces al mes, y de sobremesa una cantidad de anuncios. Entiendo que quieran que la gente pague el plan premium, pero no pueden llegar al punto de que ya la persona no pueda elegir la canción que quiera escuchar, entonces que sentido tiene una aplicación para escuchar música, si no puedes escuchar la canción que quieres escuchar, como la palabra lo dice ESCUCHAR, no que una aplicación decida que canción ponerte.
