#party and for the world A magnificent app Spotify.music And podcast,1
Too often does this app poop itself when I'm trying to play ANY song. I press on a song and the area where a song is played becomes grayed out. Nothing plays. But if I press shuffle play I can listen to a random song in my library. Please know all these songs are downloaded. I paid for premium as well. These vultures restrict my listening time on audiobooks and have ads on all of it. What's the point. I may as well pirate. Thanks for nothing. Terrible product but no refunds here. Gluttonous,1
This app is trash if I could give 0 I would,0
"Horrible, ads constantly, they pop up more and more every time, I understand that everything free needs advertising but they go overboard. Then they complain that we look for other ways to listen to music...",1
"Have premium, still getting advertising breaks in my podcasts (and I don't mean the ones baked in the recording from authors themselves). Can't turn off video for podcasts completely (seriously, why would I want video for a podcast?). Can't turn private session on permanently. Keeps shoving terrible music to my recommend feed just bacuse it's popular in my area. All ""song radios"" and mixed end up with the same exact songs after 2-3 random ones. Not worth it really",1
"It's really bad that even a little bit requires premium, I mean you have to be premium to change songs? It makes me emotional ï¿½ï",1
This is a great app because there is so much to do and so many songs,1
You are useless.,0
"Spotify employees must be starving because it's not possible, if you don't have Premium you can't even choose what you're going to listen to, skip songs or see the lyrics of the song, the way is to go to YouTube Music or download pirated stuff if you don't have the money to pay for Premium, ugh.",1
"Honestly, it's a very good application, but the only downside is that there are way too many ads (annoying ones too), and secondly, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a bit sad that we can't listen in order without paying. I still use it, but please stop putting so many ads, at least interesting ads please, thank you ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",1
"Actually good... But now my time is anything but, like clicking a song suddenly ""let's explore premium""? You can't just make people go for premium like that! So I can't play songs! And because I have no choice, I choose this song that plays, right? So how is it, I can't play songs unless I'm premium like that!? That's unfair! And I can provide evidence!",1
"It's very complete and has everything, both old and new, the best music app in the world without a doubt.",1
"He plays the music he wants, it's frustrating.",1
"Good for music, I guess, other than the fact that half the time it doesn't play the song you want, works half the time, and so half of 5 stars. EDIT: Nvm, it's bad but I refuse to use Pandora, so I'm stuck with this.",1
It's a good app ï¿½ï,0
Awesome,0
My amnesia song application already has an account but the password keeps being wrong.,1
This app is getting worse and worse.,0
Unfavorable evolution of the service,0
"I really like the app, but I am so fed up with the ad about how to create my own ads and the bad thing is that it's the same ad 7 times in a row, I know it by heart now. Regards.",1
Bad app fr everything need premium now,1
"Why is the song search history always deleted? Is it because of a bug or do you have to be premium? If it's a bug, please fix it immediately because it's really annoying to search for songs again. If you have to be premium so that the search history doesn't get deleted, that's really bad, don't do that Spotify, don't make everything require premium.",1
When i want to listen to my playlist spotify adds songs that i don't want in my playlist and i can't skip them. You shouln't add songs that aren't added by the creator of the playlist.,1
"Switch device for no reason while playing music. DO something, lot of poeple got this problem. TIRED of this costy app......",1
I really like this app because it makes me happy because the songs and my sadness disappear when I play the songs on this app. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to rate this app.,1
"Too many ads, I do not recommend",1
"I love Spotify, I use it every day, besides that I only listen to Billie Eilish and many other things. I pay for Premium and the app's convenience is amazing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï",1
Adds will play even if app is closed. This app made custom commercials for a very private conversation so I have a major issue with your privacy Spotify. I will need to talk to a manager about privacy or their lack of listening the private convos then I can't change my ADD preference in the freaking app I have to go to your website. Pandora will be better! Your service is only getting more trashy! No app gets to override my system!! Why do u have to bill me before the FREE MY trial!,1
Quite good,0
Verry Bad System,0
"This is a very helpful app, and it is a great streaming service.",1
